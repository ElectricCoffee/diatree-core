# Diatree Core

Diatree is a dialogue-tree management tool written in Rust.

The aim of this tool is to easily manage dialogue trees for video games in a safe, sane, and simple manner.

The core will be a stand-alone tool that via JSON RPC is capable of creating and managing various trees. 
UIs will be written as stand-alone apps that then interface with the core via JSON RPC.
